Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
- Nichelle and Sang helped me in some aspects.
Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
- Nope.. too tired of it.
Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
- 15 to 20 hours.
Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
- We need more practice on parse's commands. We also need more background knowledge on how jquery works exactly. I had to just do most part of the challenges without even understanding it. '
- instead of making us actually practice jquery, how about teaching a detailed info of how libraries like jquery interact with websites? We need more step by step approach on this topic.
